  <h2>How we created TULC:</h2>
    <p>
     Trade To Upgrade Calculator was created using Stackblitz, an online IDE where you can create Angular & React projects that are immediately online & shareable via link. With Stackblitz, it is fairly easy to create your very own site. All we needed to use was our laptops, and our creativity.
